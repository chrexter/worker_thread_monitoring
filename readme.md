How can I check the number of threads that an Actix-Web program starts for handling incoming requests?

```rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer};
use num_cpus;
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};
use std::sync::Arc;
use tokio::task;

// Create a shared counter for active tasks
struct AppState {
    active_tasks: Arc<AtomicUsize>,
}

async fn monitor_handler(data: web::Data<AppState>) -> HttpResponse {
    let current_tasks = data.active_tasks.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
    let system_threads = num_cpus::get();

    HttpResponse::Ok().json(serde_json::json!({
        "active_tasks": current_tasks,
        "system_threads": system_threads,
        "worker_threads": num_cpus::get_physical() // Physical CPU cores used by default
    }))
}

async fn sample_handler(data: web::Data<AppState>) -> HttpResponse {
    // Increment the counter when handling a request
    data.active_tasks.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);

    // Simulate some work
    task::spawn_blocking(|| {
        std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1));
    })
    .await
    .unwrap();

    // Decrement the counter when done
    data.active_tasks.fetch_sub(1, Ordering::SeqCst);

    HttpResponse::Ok().body("Request processed")
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let state = web::Data::new(AppState {
        active_tasks: Arc::new(AtomicUsize::new(0)),
    });

    HttpServer::new(move || {
        App::new()
            .app_data(state.clone())
            .route("/monitor", web::get().to(monitor_handler))
            .route("/sample", web::get().to(sample_handler))
    })
    .workers(num_cpus::get_physical()) // Set number of workers to physical CPU cores
    .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
    .run()
    .await
}

```

This code provides a way to monitor thread usage in your Actix-Web application. Here's how it works:

1. Creates an atomic counter to track active tasks
2. Provides a `/monitor` endpoint that shows:
   - Number of currently active tasks
   - Total system threads available
   - Number of worker threads (physical CPU cores)
3. Includes a sample endpoint that demonstrates task counting

To use it, just make requests to:

- `http://localhost:8080/monitor` to see thread statistics
- `http://localhost:8080/sample` to simulate work and see the counter in action

By default, Actix-Web uses the number of physical CPU cores for its worker threads. You can modify this by changing the `.workers()` parameter in the server configuration.

2. Actix-Web spins up all worker threads when the server starts, not on-demand. Let me show you how we can verify this:

```rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer};
use std::thread;

async fn get_threads() -> HttpResponse {
    let thread_name = thread::current().name().unwrap_or("unnamed").to_string();

    HttpResponse::Ok().json(serde_json::json!({
        "worker_thread": thread_name,
        "thread_id": format!("{:?}", thread::current().id())
    }))
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    println!("Starting server...");

    // Set explicit number of workers for demonstration
    const WORKERS: usize = 4;

    HttpServer::new(move || {
        println!("Worker thread initialized: {:?}", thread::current().name());

        App::new()
            .route("/thread-info", web::get().to(get_threads))
    })
    .workers(WORKERS)
    .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
    .run()
    .await
}

```

When you run this program, you'll immediately see all worker threads being initialized before any requests are made. You'll notice:

1. The worker threads are created during server startup, with names like `actix-rt:worker:0`, `actix-rt:worker:1`, etc.
2. These threads stay alive for the entire lifetime of the server
3. Each worker is capable of handling multiple concurrent requests using async/await

The output when starting the server will look something like this:

```
Starting server...
Worker thread initialized: Some("actix-rt:worker:0")
Worker thread initialized: Some("actix-rt:worker:1")
Worker thread initialized: Some("actix-rt:worker:2")
Worker thread initialized: Some("actix-rt:worker:3")
```

You can then make requests to `http://localhost:8080/thread-info` to see which worker thread handles each request. Actix-Web distributes incoming requests across these pre-initialized worker threads using a round-robin strategy by default.

This approach of pre-initializing threads is a common pattern in web servers as it:

- Eliminates thread startup overhead during request handling
- Provides predictable resource usage
- Allows for better connection handling and keep-alive support

3. The key differences between NodeJS and Actix-Web worker thread handling with examples:

```javascript
// main.js
const express = require("express");
const { Worker } = require("worker_threads");
const os = require("os");

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Pool of workers
class WorkerPool {
  constructor(size) {
    this.workers = [];
    this.nextWorker = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      const worker = new Worker(
        `
                const { parentPort } = require('worker_threads');

                parentPort.on('message', (data) => {
                    // Simulate CPU-intensive work
                    let result = 0;
                    for(let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
                        result += Math.sqrt(i);
                    }
                    parentPort.postMessage({
                        workerId: data.workerId,
                        result: result,
                        threadId: require('worker_threads').threadId
                    });
                });
            `,
        { eval: true },
      );

      this.workers.push(worker);
      console.log(`Worker ${i} initialized`);
    }
  }

  // Get next worker in round-robin fashion
  getWorker() {
    const worker = this.workers[this.nextWorker];
    this.nextWorker = (this.nextWorker + 1) % this.workers.length;
    return worker;
  }
}

// Create a worker pool with number of CPU cores
const pool = new WorkerPool(os.cpus().length);

// Handle requests in the event loop
app.get("/light", (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    message: "This is handled in the event loop",
    threadId: "main",
  });
});

// Handle CPU-intensive tasks in worker threads
app.get("/heavy", (req, res) => {
  const worker = pool.getWorker();

  worker.postMessage({ workerId: worker.threadId });

  worker.once("message", (result) => {
    res.json({
      message: "Processed in worker thread",
      ...result,
    });
  });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Main thread listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

Key differences between NodeJS and Actix-Web thread handling:

1. **Default Behavior**:

   - **NodeJS**: Single-threaded by default, using an event loop
   - **Actix-Web**: Automatically creates worker threads based on CPU cores

2. **Thread Creation**:

   - **NodeJS**: Manual worker thread creation and management needed
   - **Actix-Web**: Built-in thread pool management

3. **Task Distribution**:

   - **NodeJS**:
     - Light tasks run in the main event loop
     - Heavy tasks need explicit worker thread delegation
   - **Actix-Web**:
     - Automatically distributes all requests across worker threads
     - No manual task distribution needed

4. **Use Cases**:
   - **NodeJS Worker Threads are best for**:
     - CPU-intensive tasks
     - Parallel processing
     - Keeping the event loop free
   - **Actix-Web Workers are best for**:
     - General request handling
     - HTTP processing
     - Network I/O

Here's a complementary Actix-Web example for comparison:

```rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer};
use serde::Serialize;
use std::thread;

#[derive(Serialize)]
struct Response {
    message: String,
    thread_id: String,
    result: Option<f64>,
}

// Light task - but still handled by worker thread
async fn light_handler() -> HttpResponse {
    HttpResponse::Ok().json(Response {
        message: "Handled by Actix worker".to_string(),
        thread_id: format!("{:?}", thread::current().name()),
        result: None,
    })
}

// Heavy task - automatically handled by worker thread
async fn heavy_handler() -> HttpResponse {
    // CPU-intensive work
    let result = (0..1000000)
        .map(|i| f64::sqrt(i as f64))
        .sum();

    HttpResponse::Ok().json(Response {
        message: "Processed by Actix worker".to_string(),
        thread_id: format!("{:?}", thread::current().name()),
        result: Some(result),
    })
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .route("/light", web::get().to(light_handler))
            .route("/heavy", web::get().to(heavy_handler))
    })
    .workers(num_cpus::get())
    .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
    .run()
    .await
}

```

The main takeaway is that NodeJS requires more manual management of worker threads because of its single-threaded nature, while Actix-Web handles threading automatically. With NodeJS, you need to explicitly decide what runs in workers versus the main thread, while Actix-Web manages this for you.

This makes NodeJS more flexible but also more complex to manage, while Actix-Web provides a more opinionated but simpler threading model out of the box. The choice between them often depends on:

1. Whether you need fine-grained control over thread management
2. The type of workloads your application handles
3. Your team's expertise with thread management
